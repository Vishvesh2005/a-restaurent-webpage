    Seafood is any form of sea life regarded as food by humans, prominently including fish and shelfish.shelfish include various species of mollucus
    (eg..,such as calms,oysters, and mussels, and cephalopods such as octupus and squid),echinoderms(eg.., sea cucumbers and sea urchins).crustaceans(eg,..shrimp,crabs,lobster).
    Historically,marine mammals such as cetaceans as well as seals have been eaten as food, though that happens to a lesser extent in modern times.
    Seafood is an important source of (animal) protein in many diets around the world , especially in coastal areas.semi-vegeterians who consume seafood as the only source of meat said to  adhere to pescetaranianism.
    the harvesting of wild seafood is usually known as fishing or hunting, while the cultivation and farming of seafood is known as aquaculture and fish farming (in the case of fish).
    Most of the seafood harvest is consumed by humans, but a significant proportion is used as fish food to farm other fish or rear farm animals. Some seafoods (i.e. kelp) are used as food for other plants (a fertilizer). In these ways, seafoods are used to produce further food for human consumption. 
    Also, products such as fish oil, spirulina tablets, fish collagen, and chitin are made from seafoods. Some seafood is fed to aquarium fish, or used to feed domestic pets such as cats. A small proportion is used in medicine or is used industrially for nonfood purposes (e.g. leather).

   <p>cuisine (Italian: cucina italiana, pronounced [kuˈtʃiːna itaˈljaːna]) is a Mediterranean cuisine[1] consisting of the ingredients, recipes and cooking techniques developed across the Italian Peninsula and later spread around the world together with waves of Italian diaspora.[2][3][4] Some of these foods were imported from other cultures.
    Significant changes occurred with the colonization of the Americas and the introduction of potatoes, tomatoes, capsicums, maize and sugar beet—the latter introduced in quantity in the 18th century.[5][6] It is one of the best-known and most appreciated gastronomies worldwide.[7]
    Clockwise from top left; some of the most popular Italian foods: pizza (Margherita), pasta (carbonara), espresso, and gelato
    Italian cuisine includes deeply rooted traditions common to the whole country, as well as all the regional gastronomies, different from each other, especially between the north, the centre and the south of Italy, which are in continuous exchange.[8][9][10]
    Many dishes that were once regional have proliferated with variations throughout the country.[11][12] Italian cuisine offers an abundance of taste, and is one of the most popular and copied around the world.[13] 
    The cuisine has influenced several other cuisines around the world, chiefly that of the United States.[14]
    One of the main characteristics of Italian cuisine is its simplicity, with many dishes made up of few ingredients, and therefore Italian cooks often rely on the quality of the ingredients, rather than the complexity of preparation.[15][16] Italian cuisine is at the origin of a turnover of more than €200 billion worldwide.[17]
    The most popular dishes and recipes, over the centuries, have often been created by ordinary people more so than by chefs, which is why many Italian recipes are suitable for home and daily cooking, respecting regional specificities, privileging only raw materials and ingredients from the region of origin of the dish and preserving its seasonality.[18][19][20]</p>

   Chinese cuisine comprise cuisines originating from China. Because of the Chinese diaspora and historical power of the country, Chinese cuisine has profoundly influenced many other cuisines in Asia and beyond, with modifications made to cater to local palates. 
   Chinese food staples such as rice, soy sauce, noodles, tea, chili oil, and tofu, and utensils such as chopsticks and the wok, can now be found worldwide.
   An assortment of Chinese food. Clockwise from top left: Peking duck, misua, Kung Pao chicken, mooncakes, baijiu, wonton soup, spring rolls
   The world's earliest eating establishments recognizable as restaurants in the modern sense first emerged in Song dynasty China during the 11th and 12th centuries.[1][2] Street food became an integral aspect of Chinese food culture during the Tang dynasty,
   and the street food culture of much of Southeast Asia was established by workers imported from China during the late 19th century.[3]
   The preferences for seasoning and cooking techniques of Chinese provinces depend on differences in social class, religion, historical background, and ethnic groups.
   Geographic features including mountains, rivers, forests, and deserts also have a strong effect on the local available ingredients, considering that the climate of China varies from tropical in the south to subarctic in the northeast.
   Imperial royal and noble preference also plays a role in the change of Chinese cuisine. Because of imperial expansion and trading, ingredients and cooking techniques from other cultures have been integrated into Chinese cuisines over time.
